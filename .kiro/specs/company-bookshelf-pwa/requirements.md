# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables organizations to manage their library bookshelf inventory. The application will be designed as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform supporting multiple tenants, where each tenant represents a library (which could be a company library, department library, office library, etc.), allowing different libraries to maintain their own separate book collections while sharing the same application infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Library Management

**User Story:** As a library administrator, I want to register my library as a tenant, so that my library readers can have their own dedicated bookshelf management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new library signs up THEN the system SHALL create a separate tenant space with isolated data
2. WHEN a tenant is created THEN the system SHALL generate unique tenant identifiers and access credentials
3. IF a library name already exists THEN the system SHALL reject the registration and provide an error message
4. WHEN tenant registration is complete THEN the system SHALL send confirmation email with setup instructions

### Requirement 2: User Authentication and Access Control

**User Story:** As a library user, I want to log in using my email address with verification code, so that I can securely access my library's bookshelf system with appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their email THEN the system SHALL send a verification code to that email
2. WHEN a user enters the correct verification code THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and associate with their library tenant
3. IF the email domain matches a registered library tenant THEN the system SHALL allow access to that tenant's bookshelf
4. IF the verification code is incorrect or expired THEN the system SHALL deny access and allow retry
5. WHEN a user is assigned the "Library Administrator" role THEN they SHALL have permissions to add/edit/remove books, manage readers, handle requests and donations, and manage overdue notifications
6. WHEN a user is assigned the "Library Reader" role THEN they SHALL have permissions to browse, borrow, return, request, and donate books
7. WHEN a user is assigned the "Super Administrator" role THEN they SHALL have permissions to create and manage library tenants across the entire system
8. IF a user tries to perform an action outside their role permissions THEN the system SHALL deny the action and display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3: Book Catalog Management

**User Story:** As a library administrator, I want to manage the book catalog, so that library readers have access to current and accurate book information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator adds a book THEN the system SHALL require title, author, and ISBN information
2. WHEN a book is added THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct library tenant
3. IF a book with the same ISBN already exists in the library tenant THEN the system SHALL increment the quantity instead of creating a duplicate
4. WHEN a book is successfully added THEN the system SHALL make it immediately available for borrowing
5. WHEN setting up a library tenant THEN the system SHALL configure allowed email domains for that library
6. WHEN an administrator removes a reader THEN the system SHALL revoke their access and return any borrowed books

### Requirement 4: Book Discovery and Browsing

**User Story:** As a library reader, I want to browse and search available books in our library bookshelf, so that I can find books to borrow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reader accesses the bookshelf THEN the system SHALL display only books belonging to their library tenant
2. WHEN browsing books THEN the system SHALL show book title, author, availability status, and current borrower if applicable
3. WHEN a reader searches for books THEN the system SHALL filter results by title, author, or ISBN within their library tenant scope
4. IF no books match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message

### Requirement 5: Book Borrowing and Returning

**User Story:** As a library reader, I want to borrow and return books from the library bookshelf, so that I can read them and make them available for others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reader selects an available book THEN the system SHALL allow them to borrow it
2. WHEN a book is borrowed THEN the system SHALL update the book status to "borrowed" and record the borrower and date
3. IF a book is already borrowed THEN the system SHALL prevent additional borrowing and show current borrower information
4. WHEN a book is borrowed THEN the system SHALL send notification to the borrower with due date information
5. WHEN a reader returns a book they borrowed THEN the system SHALL update the book status to "available"
6. WHEN a book is returned THEN the system SHALL clear the borrower information and update the return date
7. IF a reader tries to return a book they didn't borrow THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and show an error message
8. WHEN a book is returned THEN the system SHALL send confirmation notification to the reader

### Requirement 6: Barcode Scanning Integration

**User Story:** As a library user, I want to scan ISBN barcodes for book operations, so that I can quickly perform actions without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scans an ISBN barcode THEN the system SHALL automatically populate book information from a book database
2. WHEN an administrator scans to add/edit/remove books THEN the system SHALL pre-fill title, author, and metadata and allow full book management
3. WHEN an administrator scans to borrow/return on behalf of readers THEN the system SHALL identify the book and update its status
4. WHEN a reader scans to borrow/return their own books THEN the system SHALL identify the book and process the transaction if authorized
5. IF a reader attempts barcode scanning for add/edit/remove operations THEN the system SHALL deny access and show permission error
6. IF the ISBN is not found in the database THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry of book details (administrators only)

### Requirement 7: Overdue Management

**User Story:** As a library administrator, I want to manage overdue books and send notifications, so that books are returned on time and remain available for others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a book becomes overdue THEN the system SHALL automatically send email reminders to the borrower
2. WHEN a book is 7 days overdue THEN the system SHALL send escalation notifications to administrators
3. WHEN viewing overdue books THEN the system SHALL display days overdue and borrower contact information
4. WHEN a reader has overdue books THEN the system SHALL prevent them from borrowing additional books

### Requirement 8: Book Requests and Donations

**User Story:** As a library reader, I want to request new books and donate existing books, so that the library collection can grow and improve based on reader needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reader requests a book THEN the system SHALL capture book details and requester information
2. WHEN a book is requested THEN the system SHALL notify library administrators about the request
3. WHEN multiple readers request the same book THEN the system SHALL track the demand count
4. WHEN an administrator approves a request THEN the system SHALL notify the requester when the book is added
5. WHEN a reader offers to donate a book THEN the system SHALL capture book details and donor information
6. WHEN a donation is offered THEN the system SHALL notify library administrators for approval
7. WHEN an administrator approves a donation THEN the system SHALL add the book to the library inventory
8. WHEN a donation is processed THEN the system SHALL send confirmation to the donor

### Requirement 9: Progressive Web App Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the application as a Progressive Web App, so that I can have a native app-like experience with offline capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the browser SHALL offer installation as a PWA
2. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL provide native app-like experience with app icon
3. WHEN the installed app is opened THEN the system SHALL load without browser UI elements
4. WHEN the app receives updates THEN the system SHALL prompt user to refresh for the latest version
