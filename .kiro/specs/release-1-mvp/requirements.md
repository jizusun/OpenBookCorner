# Requirements Document - Release 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## Introduction

This release validates the core circulation loop by delivering a functional, secure, multi-tenant application to a single early-adopter tenant. The focus is on the essential book borrowing and returning workflow with minimal but complete functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation & User Registration (Slice 1)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a multi-tenant architecture from day one so that the application can scale to multiple organizations while maintaining complete data isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is created THEN it SHALL be designed with multi-tenancy as a core architectural principle
2. WHEN a user registers THEN they SHALL use their corporate email and receive a verification code
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL only access their specific tenant's library data
4. WHEN the initial tenant is created THEN it SHALL be done manually by the development team
5. WHEN the initial librarian account is created THEN it SHALL be done manually by the development team

### Requirement 2: Manual Book Entry (Slice 2)

**User Story:** As a librarian, I want to manually enter book details using a simple web form so that I can build our library's catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in librarian accesses the book entry form THEN they SHALL be able to input title, author, and ISBN
2. WHEN a librarian submits the book form THEN the book SHALL be added to their tenant's catalog
3. WHEN a book is added THEN it SHALL be marked as available by default
4. WHEN the book entry form is displayed THEN it SHALL have a minimal, functional UI design
5. IF ISBN scanning is requested THEN the system SHALL NOT support it in this slice

### Requirement 3: Simple Catalog View (Slice 3)

**User Story:** As a library member, I want to view our library's catalog as a simple list so that I can see what books are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN viewing the catalog THEN each book SHALL display title, author, and availability status
3. WHEN the catalog is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT include pagination functionality
4. WHEN the catalog is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT include search functionality
5. WHEN a book is borrowed THEN it SHALL show as unavailable in the catalog

### Requirement 4: Core Circulation Loop (Slice 4)

**User Story:** As a library member, I want to borrow and return books through a simple digital process so that I can access library materials without physical scanning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member selects an available book from the catalog THEN they SHALL be able to confirm borrowing it
2. WHEN a book is borrowed THEN it SHALL be associated with the member and marked as unavailable
3. WHEN a member accesses their "My Books" page THEN they SHALL see all their currently checked-out books
4. WHEN a member chooses to return a book THEN it SHALL become available again in the catalog
5. WHEN a book is borrowed or returned THEN NO physical scanning SHALL be required
6. WHEN a book is borrowed THEN it SHALL have a due date assigned (default 14 days)
